Here are a few of my projects:

## Exploratory Data Analysis Project
Demonstrates expertise in exploratory data analysis by extracting, cleaning, and analysing a loan approvals dataset from a Finance Company. Encompasses extraction of data from an RDS database using SQLAlchemy, then cleaning and transformation using Pandas, before conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to answer business questions supported by data visualisations and reports.

## Multinational Retail Data Centralisation
Comprehensive project aimed at transforming and analysing large datasets from multiple data sources. Utilising the Pandas, cleaning the data, and producing a STAR based database schema for optimised data storage and access. The project also builds complex SQL-based data queries, allowing the user to extract valuable insights and make informed decisions.

## PowerBI Ecommerce Report
Project consists of several key tasks, including importing and transforming data from various sources, building a data model based around a star-based schema, creating an advanced date table for time intelligence, and building a professional-looking report with interactive elements and predictive modelling. The project also includes writing SQL queries to provide data insights for use outside of the Power BI ecosystem.

## Pinterest Data Pipeline 
Pinterest Data Pipeline project, an end-to-end AWS-hosted data pipeline inspired by Pinterestâ€™s experiment processing pipeline The pipeline is developed using a Lambda architecture. The batch data is ingested using AWS API Gateway and AWS MSK and then stored in an AWS S3 bucket. The batch data is then read from the S3 bucket into Databricks where it is processed using Apache Spark. The streaming data is read near real-time from AWS Kinesis using Spark Structured Streaming in Databricks and stored in Databricks Delta Tables for long term storage.
